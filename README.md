## Background
This is a power Bi project on sales analysis of **Superstore**. The project is to analyse and drive insights to answer crucial questions and help the store make data driven decisions. 

*Disclaimer*: _All datasets and reports do not represent any organizations, institution and country, but just a dummy dataset to demonstrate capabilities of power Bi_.

## Problem Statement 
In this superstore analysis portfolio project, we gain insights into its sales data to optimize its operations and improve profitability. During my analysis I am particularly interested in understanding the following 

## Data Source
The primary dataset used for this analysis is Kaggle 

## Skills and Concepts demonstrated
The following Power Bi features were incorporated
•	Excel-Data Cleaning
•	Filter,
•	DAX,
•	Tooltips
•	Buttons (Menu button, Back button arrow, information button and Help button)
•	Conditional formatting 
### Data Cleaning and preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting 

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- What are the top 5 and bottom sales categories?
- What are the top payment and ship mode?
